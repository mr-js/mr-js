## 👋 Hi, I'm Mr. JS

💎 Python developer to bring your projects to life


## 🔧 What do I do:

✅ Lightweight functional web applications and services on Flask microframework: simplicity and minimalism, flexibility and extensibility, low iron requirements and high speed

✅ Cross-platform desktop applications and scripts: work "out-of-the-box" simultaneously under Windows/MacOS/Linux and have a single modern fast and responsive adaptive interface

✅ Data analysis and processing of any complexity: from scraping/parsing web resources to parsing any file format (for example, working with DOCX/PDF without Microsoft/Adobe software or parsing a binary format file)


## ⚠️ Please note:

❌ I don't take on refining other people's projects, but I can help to understand the source code (paid consultation)

❌ I don't take on specialized template tasks that can be done via no-code/low-code platforms (e.g. chatbots)

❌ I don't take on implementation of security mechanism bypasses (e.g. captcha) and I don't guarantee integrations with third-party solutions


## 🏆 Why me:

✅ Quick start
✅ Always on call
✅ No prepayment

🔒 Without prepayment: the project is divided into stages (minimum 4-8 hours, maximum 20-40 hours), payment only after demonstration and agreement of results for each stage, source code after full payment and project completion.

📌 For the best result it is always better to have a Terms of Reference (detailed TOR) - if there is no TOR, then immediately send at least the Concept of your project: what is the idea, purpose and principle of operation. I do not participate in calls and conferences, I only take on projects that interest me.
