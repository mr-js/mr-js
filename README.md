### Hi, I'm Mr. JS 👋

# 🚀 Rapid software design and development

💎 Python developer with 5+ years of experience

## 🔧 What do I do:

✅ Turnkey lightweight and functional web applications on Flask microframework (including Rest API Werkzeug Jinja2 JSON JavaScript JQuery HTML CSS Bootstrap)

✅ Cross-platform desktop applications and scripts (work out-of-the-box on Windows/MacOS/Linux, including GUI)

✅ Data scraping & parsing of any complexity from scratch (from automated requests to live user emulation, including bypassing security mechanisms)

✅ Data analysis and processing of any complexity from scratch (from manual RE/LXML/Pandas parsing to AI)

✅ Development of Docs As Code technical documentation for programmers (Markdown AsciiDoc docToolchain reStructuredText Sphinx), as well as native work with DOCX/PDF without pre-installed Microsoft and Adobe software

✅ Automation of modern communications (e.g., collecting, processing, and forwarding your mail to your Telegram)

✅ Automation of any manual operations (e.g., collecting all your mail and sending it to your Telegram Bot or emulation of typing and keystrokes in old software)

🔒 No prepayment: payment only after demonstration of intermediate results, source code after full payment.

## ⚠️ Please note:

❌ I do not take on the task of finalizing other people's projects (I can only help you understand Python source code)

❌ I do not guarantee the performance of integrations with third-party solutions, including bypassing security mechanisms (e.g. Cloudflare or ReCaptcha)

❌ I do not participate in calls, conferences and telegram groups (just avito chat, email and github)

## 🏆 Why me:

✅ Quick start
✅ Individual approach
✅ Regular reports
✅ No prepayment
✅ 20+ years in IT

📌 I only take on projects that interest me. For better results it is always better to have a detailed Technical specification for development.
