👋 Hi, I'm Mr. JS: Python developer to bring your ideas and projects to life ✨

## 🔧 What I do

✅ Lightweight and functional web services on the Flask/FastAPI microframeworks: include a modern responsive interface and Bootstrap-based design

✅ Desktop applications and application utilities: run out-of-the-box on Windows/MacOS/Linux simultaneously, have the same interface and unlimited functionality

✅ System utilities and scripts for various specific tasks: for example, file name obfuscation with personal data removal or fine-tuning screen parameters by hotkeys

✅ Analyzing and processing data of any complexity, from scraping/parsing web resources to parsing any file format: for example, working with DOCX/XLSX/PDF without Microsoft Word/Excel software or creating/updating your offline directory based on data from various web resources in one click

✅ Automation of any routine operations: e.g. emulation of user actions for inputting and retrieving data processing results in any legacy program

## 🏆 Why me

✅ 10+ years of experience
✅ Quick start
✅ Always available
✅ No prepayment required

🔒 No prepayment: the project is divided into stages (from 8 to 40 hours), payment only after demonstration and approval of the results for each stage, source code after full payment and completion of the project.

📌 For best results: it is always a good idea to have at least a brief concept of your project, presented in a single document (idea, purpose, and principle of operation), and ideally a detailed Technical Specification | Terms of Reference (TS|ToR).

⚠️ Please note: I do not provide free consultations or technical support, nor do I participate in conference calls or conferences. Payment is hourly, according to the rate specified in the relevant section. I give priority to interesting projects lasting 40 hours or more.

💳 Details and payment: officially to the account of an individual entrepreneur (operating for more than 10 years, main activity classifier 62.0 Computer software development) online with a receipt issued. For legal entities, there is cashless payment and an account agreement via electronic document exchange (large projects).
