## 👋 Hi, I'm Mr. JS

✨ Python developer to bring your projects to life


## 🔧 What do I do

✅ Lightweight and functional web services on the Flask microframework: include a modern responsive interface and Bootstrap-based design

✅ Desktop applications and application utilities: run out-of-the-box on Windows/MacOS/Linux simultaneously, have the same interface and unlimited functionality

✅ System utilities and scripts for various specific tasks: for example, file name obfuscation with personal data removal or fine-tuning screen parameters by hotkeys

✅ Analyzing and processing data of any complexity, from scraping/parsing web resources to parsing any file format: for example, working with DOCX/PDF without Microsoft/Adobe software or creating/updating your offline directory based on data from various web resources in one click

✅ Automation of any routine operations: e.g. emulation of user actions for inputting and retrieving data processing results in any legacy program


## ⚠️ Please note

❌ I do not guarantee integrations with third-party solutions (as they can always be changed by a third party), I do not implement bypassing protection mechanisms and I do not take on finalization of other people's projects (but I can always help to solve almost any situation)


## 🏆 Why me

✅ Quick start
✅ Always on call
✅ No prepayment
✅ 10+ years' IT experience

🔒 Without prepayment: the project is divided into stages (minimum 4-8 hours, maximum 20-40 hours), payment only after demonstration and agreement of results for each stage, source code after full payment and project completion.

📌 For the best result it is always better to have a Terms of Reference (detailed TOR) - if there is no TOR, then immediately send at least the Concept of your project: what is the idea, purpose and principle of operation. I do not participate in calls and conferences, I only take on projects that interest me.
