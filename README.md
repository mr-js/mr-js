## 🔧 What I Do

*   ✅ **Lightweight and functional web services:** built on micro-frameworks Flask/FastAPI, featuring a modern responsive interface and Bootstrap-based design
*   ✅ **Cross-platform desktop applications:** work "out of the box" on Windows/MacOS/Linux with a unified user interface and UX/UI ergonomics
*   ✅ **System utilities and scripts:** automation of any routine operations (e.g., emulating user actions/input in a web browser or obfuscating/removing personal data from files)
*   ✅ **Data analysis and processing of any complexity:** from web scraping/parsing to parsing files of any format (e.g., working with DOCX/XLSX/PDF without Microsoft Word/Excel software)

## 🏆 Why Choose Me

*   ✅ 10+ years of experience
*   ✅ Always available
*   ✅ Fast start

📌 **Work Terms:** I work on an hourly basis (rate specified in the relevant section) and only take on projects that interest me. Each project is broken down into stages, with subsequent payments made after demonstration and approval of results for each stage (source code is transferred upon full payment and project completion). For the best result and a quick start, it's always advisable to develop and provide me with a detailed Technical Specification (TS) for your project.

⚠️ **Limitations:** I do not participate in calls or work on refining someone else's source code, nor do I provide guarantees for integrations with third-party solutions.

💳 **Payment Details & Payment:** official payments to the account of an individual entrepreneur (operating for over 10 years, main activity classifier 62.0 Computer software development) online with a receipt issued. For legal entities, wire transfer and an electronic contract/invoice via EDI are available (for large projects).
